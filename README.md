# Prunning-
Prepruning stops the growth of the tree early based on preset criteria to avoid overfitting(model - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mRweTWN7FhPDmgAkn65HNzT4yTMiPu_s?usp=sharing). Postpruning trims the fully grown tree to remove parts that do not contribute significantly to predictive power, usually resulting in a more simplified model(model- https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19N7v2ZMbQmCIQJgn9cciJ32Gpq2wXSUA?usp=sharing)
